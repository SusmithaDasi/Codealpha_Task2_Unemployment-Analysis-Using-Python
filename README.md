# Unemployment Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends using Python. The goal is to extract insights from unemployment datasets and visualize patterns using data analytics techniques.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes information on unemployment rates across different regions and time periods.
- Key attributes: Date, Unemployment Rate, Region, Age Group, and Gender.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, clean missing values, and handle inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate summary statistics and visualize trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps to represent unemployment trends.
4. **Analysis & Insights**: Identify factors influencing unemployment rates over time.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
3. Analyze visualizations and statistical outputs.

## Results
- Unemployment rate trends over different time periods and regions are analyzed.
- Graphical representations help in understanding the impact of economic conditions.

## Future Enhancements
- Include machine learning models to predict future unemployment trends.
- Integrate real-time data sources for updated analysis.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for better data visualization.
